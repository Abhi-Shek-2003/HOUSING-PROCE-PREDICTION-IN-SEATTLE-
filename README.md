# Housing Price Prediction in Seattle

Welcome to the Housing Price Prediction project! This repository contains code and data for predicting housing prices in Seattle using various machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in Seattle based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and more. Accurate predictions of housing prices can benefit potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents by providing insights into the market trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes historical data on housing prices in Seattle. It contains various features that impact the price of a house. 

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- `price`: Price of the house
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `sqft_lot`: Square footage of the lot
- `zipcode`: Zip code of the house


## Technologies and Libraries

This project uses the following technologies and libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Modeling

The project includes the following steps for building the prediction model:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
4. **Model Training**: Training various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
